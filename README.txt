This document contains instructions and explanations regarding the group work for BM05BAM: Machine Learning & Learning Algorithms for group 11.
The group work is divided into 5 files (RNotesbooks). 

- 01_DataExploration: This document includes code for exploring, cleaning, and transforming the original data. The file outputs two .RData file. One includes the prepared data from 'csv_train', the other the prepared data from 'csv_test'. This approach is chosen in order to ensure that all group members use the same underlying data sets and that they can be easily updated for everyone.

- 02_kNN: Contains code for the kNN method (first iteration only)

- 03_LassoRegression: Contains code for the Lasso regression method (first iteration only)

- 04_GradientBoosting: Contains code for the gradient boosting decision trees (first and second iteration)

- 05_RandomForest: Contains code for the Random forest method (first and second iteration) + also includes the final test on csv_test including interpretation of the results.


Please note that you need to set up a dedicated folder "01_Output" in your working directory in order to save all outputs generated by the notebooks.
